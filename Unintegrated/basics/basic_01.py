    @audio file formats
        example: .mp3, .flac, .wav, .ogg, etc.

        dictionary: 'compress' is a process

        mp3 - most popular, but a lossy compression format
              means that it compresses
              the data that it can lose information
        flac - also popular, but a loss lesscompression format
              means that it compresses
              the data but allows us to perfectly reconstruct
              the original data
        wav - (stands for: wave form audio format)
              is a uncompressed format
              means that it stores data in a uncompressed way.
              the audio quality here is the best but the
              file size is the largest

        note: we will use wav since it is easier to work with in python

              importing wave requires no installation (it is pre-build)
